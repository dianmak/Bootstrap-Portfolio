                    <p>I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>I consider myself one of those people who don't really have a clear cut "home" nation. While
                        this
                        used to
                        make me sad, I've come to see that it is a blessing and privilege.
                        After graduating cum laude from Tufts University with a Bachelor of Science in Cognitive and
                        Brain
                        Sciences,
                        I took a job with CBI as a conference producer in the life
                        sciences industry. Prior to graduating, I completed my senior thesis on the effects of
                        caffeine
                        consumption
                        on human memory, for which I received High Thesis Honors. At
                        CBI, I had the opportunity to work with high-level executives at biopharma companies,
                        conduct
                        market
                        research on the most timely topics and problems in the industry, create
                        blueprints for the conferences assigned to me and lead a team of sponsorship, logistics,
                        marketing
                        and
                        delegate sales colleagues. The last item in my portfolio is a collection
                        I designed a few years ago at Parsons School of Design. My immediate goals are to be the
                        best
                        pawrent to
                        my
                        dog, to become a life coach within 5 years and to travel as much
                        as I can.
